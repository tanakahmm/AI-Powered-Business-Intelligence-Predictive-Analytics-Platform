# Process Flow: AS-IS vs TO-BE

## Overview
This document outlines the business process transformation achieved by implementing the AI-Powered BI Platform.

## 1. Inventory Management

### AS-IS (Manual Process)
*   **Process**: Inventory counts are updated manually in spreadsheets at the end of the day or week.
*   **Pain Points**: 
    *   Stockouts occur without warning.
    *   Overselling items (taking orders for out-of-stock items).
    *   Inaccurate profit calculations due to missing cost data.
*   **Risk**: High risk of revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction.

### TO-BE (AI-BI Platform)
*   **Process**: 
    *   Inventory is automatically deducted **instantly** when an Order is placed.
    *   System checks stock availability *before* confirming the order.
    *   Low-stock alerts are triggered automatically.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   Real-time inventory accuracy.
    *   Prevention of overselling.
    *   Automated reorder notifications.

## 2. Decision Making & Forecasting

### AS-IS (Intuition-Based)
*   **Process**: Managers guess future sales based on gut feeling or simple "last year" comparisons.
*   **Pain Points**:
    *   Overstocking or understocking.
    *   Reactive (too late) responses to market trends.
*   **Risk**: Inefficient capital allocation.

### TO-BE (Data-Driven & Predictive)
*   **Process**: 
    *   AI model analyzes historical sales data.
    *   Generates 3-month sales forecast with confidence intervals.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   Proactive inventory planning.
    *   Data-backed decisions.

## 3. Customer Retention (Churn)

### AS-IS (Reactive)
*   **Process**: Businesses only realize a customer has left when they stop buying for a long time.
*   **Pain Points**:
    *   Lost revenue.
    *   Harder to win back lost customers.

### TO-BE (Proactive Retention)
*   **Process**:
    *   AI model assigns a "Churn Risk Score" to every customer.
    *   High-risk customers are flagged on the dashboard.
    *   System suggests retention actions (e.g., "Offer Discount").
*   **Benefits**:
    *   Reduced churn rate.
    *   Increased Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
